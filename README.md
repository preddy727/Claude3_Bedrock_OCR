# Claude3_Bedrock_OCR
Python code samples for using Claude 3 models to process PDF and extract text 

This lab will walk you through the basics of connecting to the Amazon Bedrock service from Python with boto3.

You will be ready to walk through the notebook bedrock_basics.ipynb, which shows how to install the required packages, connect to Bedrock, and invoke models. Before running any of the labs ensure you've run the Bedrock boto3 setup notebook.

Specific OCR examples are in the claude3sonnet_outputscleared.ipynb
